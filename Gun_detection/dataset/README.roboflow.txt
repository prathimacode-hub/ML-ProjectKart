The dataset includes 5076 images.
Guns are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.14 percent of pixels
