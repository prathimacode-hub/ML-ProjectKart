## üìù Project Structure

Your projects should contain this flow to maintain similarity across all other projects. Make sure to note these things, before you create a PR.

**Dataset** - This folder would have a .csv file.

**Model** - This folder would have your project file (that is .ipynb file) be it analysis or prediction. Other than project file, it should also have a **'README.md'** using this [template](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md) and **'requirements.txt'** file which would be enclosed with all needed add-ons and libraries that are included in the project. (.Pkl file if available)

**Images/Screenshots** - This folder would have images added if applicable.

<!--
**Front End** - This folder would have files related to coding and designing the webpage. 

**Back End** - This folder would have files regarding backend creation for the model using Flask and Django.

**UI/UX** - This folder would have files regarding dashboards, forms and webpages for the model.

Include README.md file for 'Front End', 'Back End' and 'UI/UX' in their respective folders and elaborate briefly about how it works by showing step by step procedure using screenshots.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Things to Note

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources because that work will not be considered. Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.
* You can only work on issues that have been assigned to you.
* If you want to contribute the algorithm, it's preferrable that you create a new issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in correct folder.
* Do not update the **[README.md](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/README.md).**
