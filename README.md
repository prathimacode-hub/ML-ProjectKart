<h2>📌Repository</h2>

This kart showcases the finest collection of all projects based on machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing and everything. Indulge in this journey of open source.

The main aim is to provide an efficient and beginner-friendly projects that would help you in mastering the ML/AI algorithms and make you familiar. Turn yourself into pro with all the hands-on that got you covered.


<h2>🙌Join Here</h2>

Anyone related to technology who are looking to contribute to open-source, are all invited to hop in. This place has task for everyone.

| **Machine Learning** | **Deep Learning** | **Natural Language Processing** | **Computer Vision** | **FrontEnd Designers** | **BackEnd Developers** | **UI/UX Designers** |

**Data Analysts** - Frame the problem. Get, explore and prepare the data 

**Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing Enthusiasts** - Try different algorithms, build model, optimize the model 

**Front End Designers** – Design or code the webpage designed by designers 

**Back End Developers** – Create backend for the model using Flask or Django 

**UI/UX Designers** – Design dashboards, forms and webpages for the model 

If you had worked on or want to initiate a unique project and want to share it with the world, you can do that through here. Go through the contributing guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)👩‍💻

When issue is raised from your end (or) taken it from issues tab to add a project, elaborate as much as you could and as well notify us about the task you will be working, that might be Model Creation (or) Data Analysis (or) Front End (or) Back End (or) UI/UX Design.

Subsequently, also go through the GitHub documentation on [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).


<h2>🛠Templates to Follow</h2>

- [Feature request](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/.github/issue_template/feature_request.md)
- [Bug Report](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/.github/issue_template/bug_report.md)
- [Pull Request](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/.github/pullrequest_template.md)
- [README](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md)

**Note** : One should follow these templates while creating a new issue or pull request. Else, 'LGM-SOC' label won't be assigned neither your contributions would count.
This is to ensure that we know you as a 'LGM-SOC' participant.
If you had taken up the issue, that's already in the "Issues" tab. You should mention yourself as 'LGM-SOC' participant. 


<h2>📝Project Structure</h2>

Your projects should contain this flow to maintain similarity across all other projects. Make sure to note these things, before you create a PR.

**Dataset** - This folder would have a .csv file.

**Model** - This folder would have your project file (that is .ipynb file) be it analysis or prediction. Other than project file, it should also have a **'README.md'** using this [template](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/.github/readme_template.md) and **'requirements.txt'** file which would be enclosed with all needed add-ons and libraries that are included in the project

**Images** - This folder would have images added if applicable.

**Front End** - This folder would have files related to coding and designing the webpage. 

**Back End** - This folder would have files regarding backend creation for the model using Flask and Django.

**UI/UX** - This folder would have files regarding dashboards, forms and webpages for the model.

Include README.md file for 'Front End', 'Back End' and 'UI/UX' in their respective folders and elaborate briefly about how it works by showing step by step procedure using screenshots.


<h2>👨‍💻Workflow:</h2>

- Fork the repository

- Clone your forked repository using terminal or gitbash.

- Make changes to the cloned repository

- Add, Commit and Push

- Then in Github, in your cloned repository find the option to make a pull request 

> print("Start contributing for ML-ProjectKart")


<h2>⚙️Things to Note</h2>

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources because that work will not be considered. Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.
* You can only work on issues that have been assigned to you.
* If you want to contribute the algorithm, it's preferrable that you create a new issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in correct folder.
* Do not update the **[README.md](https://github.com/prathimacode-hub/ML-ProjectKart/blob/main/README.md).**
