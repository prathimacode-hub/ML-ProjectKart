**Project Title**

COVID19_Data-Analysis


**GOAL**

The goal is to predict what kind of resource an individual might require at the time of being tested positive or even before that will be of great help to the authorities as they would be able to procure and arrange for the resources necessary to save the life of that patient.


**WHAT I HAD DONE**

- Extract as much as information extract from the dataset with the help of EDA and visualization.
- The null values are not very clear in that so i focus in that mainly and it gives us a good lead.
- Then I used different classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**

- RandomForestClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier
- DecisionTreeClassifier

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Label encoding

**CONCLUSION**
- RandomForrestClassifier:
Accuracy: 0.6669814068001518

- Decisiontreeclassifier
Accuracy: 0.6687727782140998

**Conclusion**

- We applied three models for prediction RandomForestClassifier,KNeighborsClassifier,DecisionTreeClassifier
.
- As we can see random forest performing best (with accuracy ~ 0.66)
