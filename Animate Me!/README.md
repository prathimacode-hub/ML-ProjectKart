# Animate Me!

## About the Project:
- It is a simple OpenCV project that converts input image to a cartoon equivalent
- Unlike the classical approach, Image Quantization is used to differentiate regions

## How to Use:
- Add your image to the [Input Folder]() and/or change the corresponding image address in the [Animate_Me.py]()
- A window with the output image will pop up (You can also find the image saved in the [Output Folder]()
- To learn about the intermediary steps, run the [Animate_Me.ipynb]()

## Further Work / Improvements:
- Can convert into an API with self adjusting Edge Parameters
- Could be worked upon to create a real-time filter used on different social media platforms
