**Wine Quality Prediction**

This model predicts the quality of wine based on the following features:

- pH
- fixed Acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulphur dioxide
- total sulphur dioxide
- density
- sulphates
- alcohol


**Algorithms Used**

1. Support Vector Classifier: ----> Accuracy: 87%
2. Random Forest Classifier:  ----> Accuracy: 88%

This algorithms will predict the quality of wine.

**Model Creation**

I have deployed this model locally with the help of flask environment. The result is as follows.

**This is the homepage where user will input the data**

**After the input the model will give result as follows**

Thank You!
