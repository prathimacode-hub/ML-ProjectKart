**Problem Statement:**
The data is about Asteroids - NeoWs.
NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.

**PROJECT TITLE:** 
NASA _Asteroids_Classification

**GOAL:** 
- Finding potential hazardous and non-hazardous asteroids
- Features responsible for claiming an asteroid to be hazardous

**DATASET link:**

**MODELS USED:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBossting
 

**WHAT I HAD DONE:**
I have done the following operations on the given dataset.
- Data Exploration
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization
- Correlation
- Model Building
- Prediction.

**LIBRARIES NEEDED:**
- Pandas 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Numpy
- Sklearn

**Accuracy:**
- XGBClassifier
  0.9925373134328358
 
- Random Forrest
  0.9925373134328358

**CONCLUSION:**
From all the model we get that XGboost is the best model predictor for NASA Asteroids Classification. Hence the model built successfully and is ready to predict the churn score.
