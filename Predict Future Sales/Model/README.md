PROJECT TITLE : Predict Future Sales

GOAL : To predict whether the future sales.

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Future Sales dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used machine learning algos . In each algo I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models .
I also calculated the mean squared error and the mean absolute error, accuracy score in the given dataset of Predicting Future Sales .

LIBRARIES which I used:

PANDAS

NUMPY

MATPLOTLIB

SEABORN

SCIPY

SKLEARN

CONCLUSION :

So we get a good accuracy score of 82.47 % using the Logistic Regression.
The accuracy of the model can be increased using HyperTuning.
