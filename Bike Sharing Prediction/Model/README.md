# Bike Sharing Prediction

# GOAL 
The main goal of the project is to analyse the Bike Share Count in case of different seasons, weekdays, weathers, etc. and based on that train a model, to predict the number of bike users under a given circumstance.

# DATASET 
* (Dataset Link)[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset]

# WHAT I HAD DONE 
* Data Exploration and Visualization done with the help of EDA, to better understand the Bike Share Count Trend and get useful insights.
* I plotted various graphs for the same.
* I used Random Forest and Linear Regression to predict the number of Bike users for any given day, with any circumstance covered in the dataset.
* Hence, did the Model Creation.

# MODELS USED 
* Linear Regression
* Random Forest Regression

# LIBRARIES NEEDED 
* pandas 
* NumPy 
* seaborn 
* Matplotlib  
* scikit-learn

# CONCLUSION 
From the models used, Random Forest Regression Turned out to be the more accurate

### Mean Absolute Error:-
* RandomForestRegressor = 7.067407128774035
* LinearRegression = 8.870086069157317

## Accuracy:-
* RandomForestRegressor = 0.8262310561381094
* LinearRegression = 0.6280911769442765
