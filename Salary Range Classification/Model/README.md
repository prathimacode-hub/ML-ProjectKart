**Salary Range Classification**

**GOAL**

The goal of this project is to classify salary range from features as company, job, degree  etc.

**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/balakrishcodes/others?select=salaries.csv).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Visualization
- Step 3: Data Training
- Step 4: Model Creation
- Step 5: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression
-  Decision Tree Classifier
-  Naive Bayes
-  Random Forest Classifier



**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Logistic Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  83.33
 ``` 
 - By using Decision Tree Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  1.00
 ``` 
 - By using Naive Bayes model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  91.67
 ``` 
  - By using Random Forest Classifier model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  1.00
 ```
* Accuracy of Decision tree classifier and random forest classifier is higher than that of logistic regression and naive bayes.
