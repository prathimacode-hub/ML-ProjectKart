**DESCRIPTION**

The dataset contains the details of the various Shooting incidents that took place in New York City in the last 15 years (from 2006 to 2020). An Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed to explore the nature and uncover hidden insights that will help in detection of potential threat locations, the demographics & ethinicity of the victim & the perpretator, and estimation of number of casualties.

>I have leveraged the dataset to derive a solution to the following questions:

* Which areas are more unsafe than others?

* Which Age group and Race account for the highest number of Perpetrators?

* Age group and Race account that accounts for the highest number of Victims?

* The exact location that has observed the highest number of incidents?

* Number of incidents that resulted in Murder vs Injuries?

* Most vulnerable Age group?

* Trend of the incidents reported from 2006 to 2020 - which year has observed the highest number of shooting incidents in New York City?


**MODELS USED**

>Random Forest 

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

>* numpy
>* pandas

**CONCLUSION**

Following conclusions can be made - 

* Most number of shooting incidents were reported from Brooklyn followed by Bronx, Queens, Manhattan and Staten Island respectively
* Maximum number of perpetators belong to the Race: Black followed by White Hispanic
* Most of the shootings resulted in Injuries with very few resulting in Murder
* Most of the Victims are from the 25-44 age group closely followed by the 18-24 age group
* There has been a gradual decrease in the number of incidents reported since 2011 except instances of slight increase in the number of cases in 2009 to 2011 and 2013 to 2014
* The number of incidents sharply rose in and after 2019 which is a matter of grave concern
