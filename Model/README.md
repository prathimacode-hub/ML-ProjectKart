**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Preparation
- Step 3: Data visualization
- Step 4: Data Training
- Step 5: Model Creation
- Step 6: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
-  Linear Regression
-  Decision Tree Regressor



**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- warnings
- nltk
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  94.87
 ``` 
 - By using Decision Tree Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.99
 ``` 

* Decision tree regressor is more efficient model.
