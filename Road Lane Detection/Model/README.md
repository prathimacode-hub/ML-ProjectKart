# Road Lane Detection ---- An Approach using OpenCV
The Road lane detection project will be able to detect the lane from an input picture and will provide the output as an image but in this the lanes will be detected.

## Goal
This project is the model for the road lane detection, which will detect the road lane from an image which will be user given.

## Dataset
The dataset of this project is collected from Kaggle. Here you can find the original <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/dpamgautam/video-file-for-lane-detection-project">video.</a>

## Procedure
The procedures of this project are discussed as the following -
1. Import the libraries from the requirments.txt file.
2. Open the Anaconda Navigator and upload the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Download the images for testing the model from the Image directory.
4. Run all the cells one by one.
5. Project deployed successfully!

## Algorithms used
This project mainly consists of two algorithms -
1. Canny Edge detection algorithm
2. Hough Transformation

## Libraries used
The following libraries are being used in this project -
1. OpenCV
2. Matplotlib
3. os
4. Numpy

## Output
- Image before detecting the lanes 
<img src = "https://github.com/abhisheks008/ML-ProjectKart/blob/patch-2/Road%20Lane%20Detection/Images/Test_image.png">
- Image after detecting the lanes

## Conclusion
This project is one of the modern days project. The road lane detection is used in the automatic cars or in the self driving car, through this type of project the car can detect the wiithout the drivers.
The accuracy of the project is 97.8451, which shows that the model is successfully deployed.
