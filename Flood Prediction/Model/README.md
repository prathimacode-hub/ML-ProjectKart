PROJECT TITLE : Flood Prediction

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/getthedata/open-flood-risk-by-postcode

GOAL : To predict the about the floods in detail.

WHAT I HAD DONE : In this project first I performed a exploratory data analysis on the Flood dataset which includes of data cleaning , data manipulation, data preprocessing , data visualization and after that I did the model building using different machine learning classification and regression algorithms and then predicted the accuracy of every model . In the model prediction part I used different machine learning algorithms . In each algorithm I had included the accuracy score , training score , classification report , confusion matrix . While in the EDA part I have included different plots for the different visualizations of our dataset . During the model prediction I got different accuracies from different models , While the other model accuracies can be increased more using the hypertuning . Some plots which I used for visualizing the dataset are Histogram , Barplot , Boxplot, Heatmap , Scatter plot , Pairplot , Jointplot etc.

ACCURACIES OF DIFFERENT MODELS ARE:

KNeighbors Classifier= 65.21 %

Naiye Bayes= 60.10 %

Decision Tree Classifier= 68.62 %

Random Forest Classifier= 79.97 %

Extra Trees Classifier= 78.80 %

Bagging Classifier = 87.34 %

LIBRARIES:

PANDAS

NUMPY

MATPLOTLIB

SEABORN

SCIPY

SKLEARN

CONCLUSION :

We got a good accuracy of about 88 % using Bagging Classifier which is quite well for the given dataset.

The accuracy of other models can be increased further by HyperTuning.
