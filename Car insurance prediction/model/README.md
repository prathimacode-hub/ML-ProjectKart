For children and young adults aged 5 to 29, road traffic accidents are the leading cause of death.Therefore, in most countries, for the sake of safety and protection, the law has made so its mandatory for all vehicle owners to have vehicle insurance.

## GOAL

Get the predictions for amount

## DATASET
You can have dataset from Dataset folder also it is availbale on kaggle 

## WHAT I HAD DONE-
I have load necessary libraries, preprossed data and build a model that predicts the insurance claim of the cars that are provided in the dataset.I have build random forest regression model
1.Loading required packages
2.Loading training data
3.Loading testing data
4.Pre-processing
5.Label encoding and scaling
6.Train a random forest regressor
7.Transfer learning with MobileNet
8.Getting the test prediction
9.MODELS USED
