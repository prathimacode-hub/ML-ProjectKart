**Concrete Strength Prediction**

**GOAL**
The goal of this project is to predict strength of the concrete form features as fly ash,blast furnamce slag, water, fine aggregate,coarse aggregate, cement, age etc.

**DATASET**
Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/prathamtripathi/regression-with-neural-networking).

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Step 2: Data training
- Step 3: Model Creation
- Step 4: Performance Evaluation


**MODELS USED**
-  Linear Regression
-  Decision Tree Regressor
-  Random Forest Regressor


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)


**CONCLUSION**
- By using Linear Regression model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  61.36
 ``` 
 - By using Decision Tree Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  99.56
 ``` 
 - By using Random Forest Regressor model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  98.44
 ```
