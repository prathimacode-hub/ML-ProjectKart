**GOAL**
The goal is to predict the price of stocks in future and make calls according to the results algorithms gave.


**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- I have explored the data of given stocks
- Make models according to data to predict the price of the stock.
- I have plotted the results of the prediction.

**MODELS USED**
-  Moving Average
-  Linear Regression
-  K-Nearest Neighbors
-  Prophet
-  LSTM

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Keras

**CONCLUSION**
Accuracy of all models are evaluated throught root mean squared error

By using Moving Average I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   14541.48874451343
 ``` 

By using Linear Regression I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   20137.79584837273
 ``` 

 By using K-nearest neighbors I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   10188.724396928814
 ``` 
By using Prophet I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   22307.770208873226
 ``` 
By using LSTM I got 
 ```python
    Accuracy:   2330.171022728133
 ```
