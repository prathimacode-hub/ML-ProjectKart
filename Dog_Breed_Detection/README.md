Given an image model predicts the breed of the dog present in the said image.

## Working
To get the model setup on your machine downlad the model from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PoZVJyJibe36KJIrdGa52YIrkPQ52uHZ/view?usp=sharing and put in the main directory.

Run the "app.py" script given in the folder if requirements satisfied it would lead to a link , open that in browser and you're ready to predict.
