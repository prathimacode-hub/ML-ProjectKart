# Kyphosis Disease Classification using decision tree and random forest


Kyphosis is a spinal disorder in which an excessive outward curve of the spine results in an abnormal rounding of the upper back.

This project allow us to predict the presence or absence of Kyphosis based on the Kpyhosis dataset using a Random Forest and Decision Tree Machine Learning Model.


# Description

Kyphosis is an abnormally excessive convex curvature of the spine. The kyphosis data frame has 82 rows and 4 columns representing data on children who have had corrective spinal surgery. 

Dataset contains 3 inputs and 1 output :

INPUTS:
- Age: in months
- Number: the number of vertebrae involved
- Start: the number of the first (topmost) vertebra operated on.

OUTPUTS:
- Kyphosis: a factor with levels absent present indicating if a kyphosis (a type of deformation) was present after the operation.
